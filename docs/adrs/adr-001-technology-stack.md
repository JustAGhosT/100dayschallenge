# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2023-07-10  
**Deciders:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Technical Advisors, UX Designer  
**Informed:** Project Stakeholders  

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a technology stack for the 100 Days Challenge Tracker application that allows for rapid development, good developer experience, and easy deployment while maintaining performance and scalability.

### Problem
Choosing the right technology stack that balances development speed, maintainability, and deployment simplicity for a full-stack web application.

### Goals
- Create a responsive, interactive user interface
- Implement a scalable backend API
- Enable simple deployment and hosting
- Ensure type safety and code quality
- Support future feature additions

### Non-Goals
- Supporting legacy browsers (IE11 and below)
- Native mobile applications (focusing on responsive web)
- Offline-first functionality (may be added later)

### Success Criteria
- Development team can build and deploy features rapidly
- Application loads and responds quickly (< 2s initial load, < 200ms API responses)
- Deployment process is automated and reliable
- Codebase is maintainable and well-typed

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Drivers
- Type safety to reduce runtime errors
- Component-based UI architecture
- Serverless architecture for simplified operations
- Modern web standards and practices
- Strong ecosystem and community support

### Business Drivers
- Limited development resources
- Need for rapid iteration
- Cost-effective hosting solution
- Time to market is important

## Considered Options

### Option 1: React + TypeScript + Netlify Functions + MongoDB
**Description:** Frontend built with React and TypeScript, backend using TypeScript-based Netlify Functions, with MongoDB as the database.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Strong type safety with TypeScript
- ✅ Component-based UI with React
- ✅ Serverless architecture simplifies operations
- ✅ Netlify provides integrated hosting and functions
- ✅ MongoDB offers flexibility for document-based data

**Cons:**
- ❌ Learning curve for TypeScript
- ❌ Serverless functions have execution time limits
- ❌ MongoDB requires separate hosting/management

**Cost/Effort:** Medium
**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL
**Description:** Full-stack Next.js application with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL database.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Unified codebase with Next.js
- ✅ Strong type safety with Prisma schema
- ✅ Relational database benefits
- ✅ Server-side rendering capabilities

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires more complex hosting setup
- ❌ Higher operational complexity
- ❌ Steeper learning curve for Prisma
- ❌ More expensive database hosting

**Cost/Effort:** High
**Risk:** Medium

### Option 3: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
**Description:** Traditional MERN stack with separate frontend and backend.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Well-established pattern
- ✅ Flexible deployment options
- ✅ Full control over backend architecture
- ✅ Large community and resources

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires separate hosting for frontend and backend
- ❌ More operational overhead
- ❌ No built-in type safety
- ❌ More complex deployment process

**Cost/Effort:** Medium
**Risk:** Medium

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option
**Selected:** Option 1: React + TypeScript + Netlify Functions + MongoDB

### Rationale
The decision was made based on:

1. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript provides strong type safety, and React offers a component-based architecture that our team is familiar with.
2. **Operational Simplicity**: Netlify Functions provide a serverless architecture that simplifies deployment and operations.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Netlify's generous free tier and pay-as-you-go model fits our budget constraints.
4. **Time to Market**: This stack allows for rapid development and deployment, which is crucial for our timeline.

### Confidence Level
**Confidence:** High

The team has experience with React and TypeScript, and Netlify Functions are well-documented with good community support. MongoDB is a proven database solution for web applications.

### Expected Outcomes
**Short-term (0-3 months):**
- Faster development cycles with TypeScript catching errors early
- Simplified deployment process with Netlify
- Reduced operational overhead

**Medium-term (3-12 months):**
- Easier maintenance due to type safety
- Ability to scale without significant architecture changes
- Lower hosting costs compared to traditional server setups

**Long-term (12+ months):**
- Codebase remains maintainable as it grows
- Ability to extend with additional Netlify features
- Flexibility to evolve the data model with MongoDB

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- ✅ Simplified deployment and hosting
- ✅ Strong type safety throughout the application
- ✅ Cost-effective serverless architecture
- ✅ Good developer experience and productivity

### Negative Consequences
- ⚠️ Netlify Functions have execution time limits (10 seconds)
- ⚠️ Cold starts may affect performance for infrequently used functions
- ⚠️ MongoDB requires separate hosting and management

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Function timeout | Medium | Medium | Optimize database queries, implement pagination |
| Cold start latency | High | Low | Keep critical functions warm, optimize function size |
| MongoDB scaling costs | Low | Medium | Monitor usage, implement caching where appropriate |

## Implementation

### Action Items
- [ ] Set up React + TypeScript frontend project - **Owner:** Frontend Dev - **Due:** Week 1
