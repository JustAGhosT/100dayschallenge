# Creating and Tracking Projects

This guide explains how to create, update, and track coding projects within your 100-day challenges.

## What is a Project?

In the 100 Days Challenge Tracker, a "project" represents a specific coding task or application you work on during your challenge. Projects help you:

- Break down your challenge into manageable pieces
- Track specific technologies you're learning
- Build a portfolio of your work
- Measure your progress over time

## Creating a New Project

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Challenge

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to the "Challenges" tab
3. Select the challenge you want to add a project to

### Step 2: Add a New Project

1. Click the "Add Project" button on your challenge page
2. Fill in the project details form

### Step 3: Fill in Project Details

1. **Title**: Give your project a descriptive name
   - Example: "Personal Portfolio Website" or "Weather Forecast App"

2. **Description**: Explain what your project does
   - Describe the functionality
   - Mention any interesting technical aspects
   - Note what you learned while building it
   - Example: "A responsive weather application that fetches data from the OpenWeather API and displays current conditions and 5-day forecasts."

3. **Repository URL** (optional): Link to your code repository
   - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
   - Example: "https://github.com/username/weather-app"

4. **Demo URL** (optional): Link to your live demo
   - Deployed version of your project
   - Example: "https://weather-app-demo.netlify.app"

5. **Technologies**: Add the tech stack you're using
   - Type each technology and press Enter
   - Examples: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS

6. **Status**: Set the current status of your project
   - **Not Started**: Planning phase, haven't begun coding
   - **In Progress**: Currently working on it
   - **Completed**: Finished and functional

7. **Progress Percentage**: Indicate how complete the project is
   - Ranges from 0% to 100%
   - Updates automatically when you change the status

### Step 4: Save Your Project

1. Review all the information you've entered
2. Click the "Save Project" button
3. Your project will appear in your challenge's project list

## Updating Project Progress

### Daily Updates

1. Visit your challenge page
2. Find the project you're working on
3. Click on the project card to open the details
4. Click the "Update Progress" button
5. Update the following:
   - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
   - Progress percentage
   - Any changes to description or links
6. Click "Save Changes"

### Marking a Project as Complete

When you finish a project:

1. Open the project details
2. Change the status to "Completed"
3. Set the progress percentage to 100%
4. Add any final notes to the description
5. Verify your repository and demo links are working
6. Click "Save Changes"

## Project Details Page

Each project has its own details page showing:

### Basic Information
- Title and description
- Status and progress
- Creation and last update dates

### Links
- Repository URL with automatic status check
- Demo URL with automatic status check

### Technology Tags
- Visual display of all technologies used
- Click on a tag to see other projects using the same technology

### Progress History
- Timeline of status updates
- Progress percentage over time

## Managing Multiple Projects

### Organizing Projects

Projects are automatically organized by:
- Creation date (newest first)
- Status (In Progress projects appear first)

You can also:
- Filter projects by technology
- Search projects by title or description
- Sort projects by different criteria

### Project Dependencies

If one project builds on another:

1. Open the dependent project
2. Click "Edit Project"
3. In the "Related Projects" section, select the prerequisite project
4. Click "Save Changes"

This creates a visual link between projects in your dashboard.

## Best Practices for Project Tracking

1. **Create realistic projects**: Choose projects you can complete within 1-7 days
2. **Update progress daily**: Even small updates help maintain momentum
3. **Document as you go**: Add notes about challenges and solutions
4. **Link to repositories**: Make it easy to find your code later
5. **Use consistent technology tags**: Helps track your skill development
